# Web-Scraping-in-R-for-Competitive-Pricing-Analysis

An important Hotel group needs to be monitoring the prices of their competitors for a specific Range of time. 

This code extracts the price, type of room, facilities, review score from the webpages booking.com and expedia.com.

It uses two excel files as an input, the first one has the Hotel name, webpage, link of the specific room. The second one has the ranges of booking that will be used to calculate a price.

This process runs every three hours and allows the hotel to adjust its rates so that they are below the competitors, this has allowed it to increase its bookings by 15%
